            <div id="text"><p>One of the most unique activities that ACC students participate in is Off the Pike, where students in the Culinary program run a food truck and pop-up restaurant. 
                The students gain hands-on authentic food service and hospitality industry experience while also fundraising for the program. 
                Typically these events make anywhere from $1000 to $1500 depending on the turn-out which is used to fund the program and everything they do.
                The process for making Off the Pike possible includes training for dining room service, the POS (Point of Sale) system, food preparation techniques, and how to be a good host. 
                In addition, all the training, developing the menu, and marketing the event are also main aspects of preparing for Off the Pike.
